### Documentation for the Existential Random Number Generator Code

---

**Title:** Existential Random Number Generator

**Description:**
This code prompts the user to generate a random number from 1 to 100 by asking them to input a number of their choice. After displaying this number, it answers the existential question of whether robots can defeat humankind.

**Language:** JavaScript

---

**Code:**

```javascript
var randomNumber = confirm("To generate a random number from 1 to 100, press OK") && (alert(`The random number is: ${prompt("Think of a number from 1 to 100, then input it below:")}`), alert("By the way, what was that question again? Could a robot defeat humankind? Hmm... I figure the answer is obvious now, peasant."));
```

---

**Usage:**

1. This code can be executed simply in a Web Browser Console.
2. When the code is executed, a confirmation dialog appears, asking the user to press "OK" to generate a random number.
3. If the user confirms, a prompt appears asking them to think of a number from 1 to 100 and enter it.
4. An alert displays the number that user entered as a random number the user wanted to generate.
5. A second alert answers the existential question about robots' ability to defeat humankind.
